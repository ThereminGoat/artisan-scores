*** THIS WAS MADE AS A RESULT OF APRIL FOOLS 2021 AND IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REAL. DO NOT FALL FOR THESE AS A REAL REVIEWS, AS THAT WOULD BE PRETTY DUMB. IT'LL ALSO BE KIND OF FUNNY, BUT MOSTLY PRETTY DUMB. ***

Hey all,

This will be the home of all of the one-sheet scoring cards for artisans that I have now decided to transition to as a result of realizing my one true calling. These are being done in the meantime while I tear down my old website and hopefully bring you fresh new meanderings about KWK, GAF, and every other maker that I have to sell the rest of my collection to be able to think about affording. 

(There are no promises as to how often things will be added to this list nor to what quantity they will be added. This is supplementary review material, at best.)

Cheers,

-Goat
